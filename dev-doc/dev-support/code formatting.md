# Code Formatting

- Install astyle from the homepage to get the latest version (2.05 required).
- Then install the astyle beautifier plugin for Qt Creator and configure it.
- Bind a keyboard shortcut to call astyle from within any file to format it. 
- Also import the subvis-qt-coding-style.xml in Qt Creator. It will help in regards to tabs and spaces**
